# Repository for my Personal Website

This is my first attempt at coding a full-stack application. I've used jQuery for the front end and Django for the backend.

The webpage has a terminal-esque interface and loads parts of my CV through CLI commands.

## templates/terminal.html

contains the html code for the page

## untitled/static/script.js

contains Jquery code for the front-end side

## untitled/static/style.css

contains css styles for the terminal like UI
